# 🧩 micro_service-ems — Hierarchy Management Utility

`micro_service-ems` is a lightweight Node.js utility built to manage **hierarchical relationships** between entities (like users, employees, or nodes) using **Prisma ORM**.  
It allows you to easily **create, update** between records — such as parent-child (prev–next) relationships — while maintaining data integrity.
